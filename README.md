# mGlu2 Mechanism Research Input Files
This repository houses the essential input files required for conducting research on the mechanisms of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2).

### Overview
Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. mGlu2 is one of the eight known mGluRs and has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
